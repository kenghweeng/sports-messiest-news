      "Sentence: Jack Grealish is wanted by Manchester City & Manchester United (Picture: Getty)Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish has emerged as a transfer target for Manchester City with Pep Guardiola already planning for next season at the Etihad, Metro.co.uk understands. The Spaniard has accepted his side will lose their Premier League crown to Liverpool given the 17-point gap between the two sides. Injuries to Leroy Sane and Aymeric Laporte have damaged Citys title defence and Guardiola feels the clubs failure to sign a centre-back last summer has been particularly harmful. City will look to rectify that this summer and could make up to five signings as Guardiola plots a similar level of incomings as was seen during his second summer in charge, when five new players arrived. Guardiola is planning an overhaul this summer (Picture: Getty)A centre-back is considered a priority but Guardiola is similarly keen to sign a box-to-box midfielder and Metro.co.uk can reveal that Grealish is under serious consideration. Guardiola was impressed by Grealish in Citys 3-0 win against Villa in October. The 24-year-old was given an advanced position on the left of midfield and though it was a difficult day for Villa, Guardiola noted Grealishs willingness to take the ball in difficult situations and his ability to break the press. A top player. Im happy he (initially) stayed in the Championship to defend his club. Hes a talented player who always creates something. An exceptional player but too expensive for Manchester! But City are set to face competition from rivals Manchester United, who are expected to test Villas resolve at the end of the season with a bid for the midfielder. City, evidently, offer the greater chance of trophies but the level of competition in Uniteds midfield is not as fierce, meaning Old Trafford would likely represent the better opportunity of regular first team football. Guardiola will get another chance to see Grealish in action when his City side face Villa on Sunday and hell no doubt be looking to impress again as Dean Smiths side bid for survival. Erik ten Hag told to get rid of three Man Utd stars if he gets Old Trafford jobGuardiola will be given a significant budget this summer as the club recognise that replacing the likes of David Silva, Fernandinho and Sergio Aguero will be costly. Fernandinho hopes to stay at the Etihad for another season, while Phil Foden is seen as the natural successor for Silva. Man Utd under pressure to appoint new manager as rival clubs plot moves for Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag\n",

Grealish, who was given an extended break after playing for England at Euro 2020, has been training with his Villa team-mates in London all week and was once again with the group on Wednesday. Aston Villa sign Leon Bailey from Bayer LeverkusenTransfer Centre LIVE! Grealish latestBarry feels sorry for Grealish: 'It brings back memories'He will now have to decide whether he wants to depart his boyhood club in a move that would represent the biggest transfer in English football history.The previous record is held by Paul Pogba, who re-joined Manchester United for 93.25m from Juventus in 2016. Villa did offer Grealish a new and improved contract earlier this summer, despite him signing a five-year deal last September. Todd Cantwell started the move and then produced an audacious assist for Adam Idah to score for Norwich, as they beat Gillingham 5-0 in a pre-season friendly (Credit: Canaries TV) Villa are expected to formalise their interest in Norwich City attacking midfielder Todd Cantwell once Grealish's move to City is finalised.As yet, there has been no official contact but Norwich are aware of Villa's interest.With less than two weeks to go until the start of the season, Norwich do not want to lose Cantwell and it would take a significant bid for them to even consider letting him go.Norwich have a good relationship with Villa after they negotiated the sale of Emiliano Buendia in June.Cantwell has entered the final year of his contract and Norwich have the option to extend it by a further year. Grealish's X-factor and his special appealSky Sports' Peter Smith\"Aston Villa supporters have been hailing him for years, celebrating a special talent which had emerged from their youth ranks. It took some time for fans of other clubs to get on board but Jack Grealish and his X-factor has won over all the judges now. At Euro 2020, the sound of England supporters cheering his warm-ups and chanting his name, urging Gareth Southgate to throw him into the action, was the perfect illustration of that.\"He appeared for just 137 minutes at that tournament but he was a major story throughout. His two assists and cameos off the bench were a tantalising glimpse of what England had in the locker and drove the conversation about how they should attack. \"It is that enticing, exciting, game-changing potential which makes him such hot property.\"Inside Wembley this summer, the change in approach from opposition defenders when he came into the game was clear to see. They dropped deeper. They doubled up. They looked nervous and wary of what might come next. It's a growing trend we've seen in the Premier League and Grealish's skill, Grealish's reputation has now earned international respect, too.\"That possibility of what Grealish could do at the top end of the Premier League or in the Champions League is clearly a question being pondered at Manchester City. The great Pep Guardiola attracted by the potential of greatness from Grealish.\"But those deep Villa roots mean Grealish won't be easy to prise away from his hometown club. His iconic status there would be enhanced if he stayed on. It's a pivotal moment in his career and, just like during the Euros, there is real intrigue with what he does next.\"The view from Villa: You wouldn't blame Grealish Sky Sports' Gerard Brand...\"Of course, if Villa are to lose Grealish, the impact will be felt. The three months without him last season were a worrying case study: Villa won just 21 per cent of their games without, and won 54 per cent with their skipper.\"But Villa's glass should remain half full. In NSWE, they have owners clearly willing to make heavy yet sound investments and will have undoubtedly planned for Grealish's potential exit - the 38m signing of Emi Buendia and interest in Leon Bailey, linked with the Premier League's elite over the past 18 months, are evidence of that. That should go some way to plugging the creativity gap.\"And although he ended up signing a new deal with Arsenal, the attempt to capture Emile Smith Rowe was still a great show of ambition, given Villa rarely sign assets from big Premier League rivals.\"Villa aren't new to this. The so-called top six have come calling for their best regularly over the past decade, but unlike when Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph were taken away in 2015, the Villa Grealish might be leaving behind is a strong one. Villa are in the best place they have been since 2010, and the 25-year-old still has a big decision to make. \"At Man City, he is guaranteed trophies, and those questioning how much playing time he will get should remember Pep Guardiola hands out minutes like no other manager in the Premier League. City made 136 changes last season, more than any Premier League side; it's clear Guardiola doesn't necessarily need a set XI for success, especially with around 60 games a season to play.\"And those arguing that a trophy with his boyhood club would be sweeter than anything he could achieve at City should remember Villa's trophy cabinet hasn't been opened since Grealish was six months old.\"While Villa are on the up, and a City move undoubtedly brings risks, you wouldn't blame Grealish for backing himself as he approaches his peak years.\"Follow the summer transfer window with Sky SportsYou can follow all the latest transfer news and rumours in our dedicated Transfer Centre blog on Sky Sports' digital platforms, as well as keeping track of all the developments on Sky Sports News.

      "Sentence: Jack Grealish has a 100m release clause in his contract; Grealish was torn about the decision to leave but Villa feel they are probably two or three years away from where they would need to be in their project to convincehim to stay Jack Grealish has completed a medical at Manchester City ahead of his proposed 100m transfer from Aston Villa.City submitted their offer on Friday and it activated a 100m release clause in Grealish's Villa contract. The move would represent the biggest transfer in English football history, breaking the previous record held by Paul Pogba who rejoined Manchester United for 93.25m from Juventus in 2016. Man City close to agreeing 100m Jack Grealish dealWhy Jack Grealish is in demandTransfer Centre LIVE!Grealish, who was given an extended break after playing for England at Euro 2020, has been training with his Villa team-mates in London all week and was once again with the group on Wednesday. It has been very difficult for 25-year-old Grealish to decide if he wants to leave the club he has supported all his life and been a part of for 19 years. He was absolutely torn about the decision. Villa feel they are probably two or three years away from where they would need to be in their project to convince Grealish to stay. But they feel his departure may actually end up accelerating that process.Villa did offer Grealish a new and improved contract earlier this summer, despite him signing a five-year deal last September.Grealish is a Villa academy graduate and has made over 200 appearances for the club, scoring 32 goals.Villa expected to declare formal interest in Cantwell Todd Cantwell started the move and then produced an audacious assist for Adam Idah to score for Norwich, as they beat Gillingham 5-0 in a pre-season friendly. (Credit: Canaries TV) Villa are expected to formalise their interest in Norwich City attacking midfielder Todd Cantwell once Grealish's move to City is finalised.As yet, there has been no official contact, but Norwich are aware of Villa's interest.With less than two weeks to go until the start of the season, Norwich do not want to lose Cantwell, and it would take a significant bid for them to even consider letting him go.Norwich have a good relationship with Villa after they negotiated the sale of Emiliano Buendia in June.Cantwell has entered the final year of his contract, and Norwich have the option to extend it by a further year. Grealish's X-factor and his special appealSky Sports' Peter Smith\"Aston Villa supporters have been hailing him for years, celebrating a special talent which had emerged from their youth ranks. It took some time for fans of other clubs to get on board but Jack Grealish and his X-factor has won over all the judges now. At Euro 2020, the sound of England supporters cheering his warm-ups and chanting his name, urging Gareth Southgate to throw him into the action, was the perfect illustration of that.\"He appeared for just 137 minutes at that tournament but he was a major story throughout. His two assists and cameos off the bench were a tantalising glimpse of what England had in the locker and drove the conversation about how they should attack. \"It is that enticing, exciting, game-changing potential which makes him such hot property.\"Inside Wembley this summer, the change in approach from opposition defenders when he came into the game was clear to see. They dropped deeper. They doubled up. They looked nervous and wary of what might come next. It's a growing trend we've seen in the Premier League and Grealish's skill, Grealish's reputation has now earned international respect, too.\"That possibility of what Grealish could do at the top end of the Premier League or in the Champions League is clearly a question being pondered at Manchester City. The great Pep Guardiola attracted by the potential of greatness from Grealish.\"The view from Villa: You wouldn't blame Grealish Sky Sports' Gerard Brand...\"Of course, if Villa are to lose Grealish, the impact will be felt. The three months without him last season were a worrying case study: Villa won just 21 per cent of their games without, and won 54 per cent with their skipper.\"But Villa's glass should remain half full. In NSWE, they have owners clearly willing to make heavy yet sound investments and will have undoubtedly planned for Grealish's potential exit - the 38m signing of Emi Buendia and interest in Leon Bailey, linked with the Premier League's elite over the past 18 months, are evidence of that. That should go some way to plugging the creativity gap.\"And although he ended up signing a new deal with Arsenal, the attempt to capture Emile Smith Rowe was still a great show of ambition, given Villa rarely sign assets from big Premier League rivals.\"Villa aren't new to this. The so-called top six have come calling for their best regularly over the past decade, but unlike when Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph were taken away in 2015, the Villa Grealish might be leaving behind is a strong one. Villa are in the best place they have been since 2010, and the 25-year-old still has a big decision to make. \"At Man City, he is guaranteed trophies, and those questioning how much playing time he will get should remember Pep Guardiola hands out minutes like no other manager in the Premier League. City made 136 changes last season, more than any Premier League side; it's clear Guardiola doesn't necessarily need a set XI for success, especially with around 60 games a season to play.\"And those arguing that a trophy with his boyhood club would be sweeter than anything he could achieve at City should remember Villa's trophy cabinet hasn't been opened since Grealish was six months old.\"While Villa are on the up, and a City move undoubtedly brings risks, you wouldn't blame Grealish for backing himself as he approaches his peak years.\" Follow the summer transfer window with Sky SportsYou can follow all the latest transfer news and rumours in our dedicated Transfer Centre blog on Sky Sports' digital platforms, as well as keeping track of all the developments on Sky Sports News.New series: Football's Cult Heroes Football's Cult Heroes is a new podcast series exploring the stories of players that carried their clubs on their backs - on and off the pitch.

      "Sentence: Get unlimited access to our expertanalysis with a sport-only Telegraph subscription - 40 for 12 months(less than 1 a week) Manchester City will consider Jack Grealish as a summer target should they receive their asking price from Bayern Munich for Leroy Sane. Grealish is expected to be the subject of bids when the Premier League season ends, with Manchester United also watching his situation at Aston Villa as they battle to avoid Premier League relegation. Pep Guardiola is a huge admirer of Grealish, describing him as one of the best players in the league before facing Villa in the League Cup final this season. Im a big fan of him, said the City manager. Guardiola has stated he is not looking for a like-for-like replacement for Sane as a left-sided forward but Grealish, 24, is seen as a player who can operate in central midfield and an attacker. Sane has made it clear he wants to leave the club for Bayern and has refused to sign a new contract, meaning he could leave at the end of next season without a fee. Bayerns valuation of 35 million is considered derisory at City, who would rather let Sanes contract expire than accept a deal below market value. An eventual transfer is expected to go beyond 50 million. Grealish will come into Citys thinking if that deal can be struck for Sane with the Bundesliga champions. Guardiola will also lose David Silva from his midfield at the end of the campaign and central defence is also an area that needs strengthening. Grealishs form for Villa under Dean Smith took him to the brink of an England call-up before the coronavirus pandemic halted football and pushed back the European Championships to 2021. It is understood he would look at a move to test himself at the next level. United have been long-term admirers of Grealish, who saw a 25 million move to Tottenham collapse two years ago. He has since helped his boyhood club reach the Premier League and has given them a chance of survival. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looked at homegrown talent last summer when he brought in Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, and Grealish fits the bill as a young player with potential to fill rather than a marquee signing. He scored nine goals in 29 starts before football shut down, and Villa picking up two points since the restart.
